The Board, serving as volunteers, sets the policies and goals of the organization. If the Chamber of Commerce is large enough, the Board employs an administrative head.\nWHAT DO THE VOLUNTEERS DO?\nVolunteers provide the ideas, the drive, the goals, the funds and the voluntary services to keep the Chamber of Commerce motivated and operating.\nDO MEMBERS EVER DISAGREE WITH WHAT THE CHAMBER DOES?\nThe only way for the Chamber to avoid disagreement on some ground is to do nothing at all, or do only those rare things in which everybody agrees. But that would mean a meaningless or feeble programme of activity.\nWHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF MEMBERSHIP?\nThe major benefit of membership is the Chamber of Commerce acts as the unified voice of the area businesses, including industry and professional firms. Strong membership involvement in its activities will increase the impact and effectiveness of the organisation. Chamber of Commerce membership is an investment in the present and future of the individual\u2019s and the community\u2019s welfare.\nWHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF A CHAMBER TO THE COMMUNITY?\nIn any community, it is from the profitable operation of business that all other benefits result. Only by succeeding in this fundamental goal can a community provide the jobs and produce the wealth to finance all of the cultural, charitable and various other needs a community is faced with everyday.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat is the Chamber of Commerce there for?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe role of the Chamber of Commerce is to promote local businesses, represent them on business related issues, and also sponsor local business events. A Chamber of Commerce is a non profit organisation of local businesses.\n\u00a0\nChambers of Commerce exist to make a difference to your business, whether that means ensuring your views are heard within government, opening new business opportunities in local, national and international markets or providing critical business advice, services and skills development.\n\u00a0\nA Chamber of Commerce refers to an association of business people to advance commercial and industrial interests in the community. Some offer awards to its members to recognise and celebrate business excellence through the successes and achievements of the members.\n\u00a0\nYour local Chamber of Commerce is a trade organisation that is designed to promote commerce (business) within their community. The Chamber is a great place to find businesses in your area that offer goods and services in your community.\n\u00a0\nThe Chamber of Commerce is a network of businesses whose main objective is to promote and ensure the livelihood of local businesses. A board of directors, who are active members in their local Chamber of Commerce, set the policies for the organisation.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSurvey 2013 \u2013 5 Simple Questions & anything else people felt relevant.\n1.
