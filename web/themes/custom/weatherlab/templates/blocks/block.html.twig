{# 
  This is a base block template file.

  It embeds the base block from PL, in `site-components/blocks/_block.twig`.

  It has some extra features that Drupal Core block templates don't provide, such as:
  - sets a `block_type` class if it's a content block (menu blocks already get this)
  - can have extra classes added via the UI when creating block
  - - these are added via the `block_classes` variable
  - has a `.block__title` class for the block title, rather than just h2
