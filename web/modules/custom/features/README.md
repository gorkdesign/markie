These features include the needed fields for a base for each of the items concerned.
You might need to add more fields for specific items for specific projects.

Also included for the media items paragraph bundles are individual entity browsers.

## TODO
Add in image crop default styles. This is a step that takes a lot of configuration so would be good to have a base feature for it.
